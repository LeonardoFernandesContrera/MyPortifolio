            <h3>About</h3>

            <p>I’m a software engineer focused on building reliable, scalable systems with a strong emphasis on backend development. I enjoy working across the full stack when needed, but my main interests lie in backend architecture, system design, and long-term maintainability.

I have over three years of experience developing secure web applications, primarily for enterprise and financial environments. I’ve worked end-to-end on systems used daily by thousands of users — from designing RESTful APIs and backend services in C# and .NET, to database integration, performance optimization, and frontend delivery.

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to mission-critical products such as internet banking platforms, POS systems, and voucher management systems, always prioritizing reliability, security, and clean, maintainable code. I value collaborative environments and regularly contribute to architectural discussions, code reviews, and continuous improvement initiatives.

I’m currently pursuing an MBA in Software Engineering and remain open to opportunities where I can contribute to impactful systems while continuing to grow in backend development, architecture, and scalable solutions.</p>
